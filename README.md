# Javier's Portfolio

## Description 

Ladies and gentlmen welcome to the official portfolio of me, Javier Banuelos! This will have all the collected works focused around my time in a coding bootcamp. While yes, many of these pieces you will see are the result of homework assignments, they will hold no less of my heart and soul than my personal passion projects. I am thoroughly enjoying my time learning to program and will no doubt have an equally thrilling time putting forward products for clients in the future.

You will notice, however, a theme or trend among my websites. If you haven't figured it out yet, I'll spell it out for you here. I am a **major** nerd! I love comics, anime, games, books, Dungeons and Dragons, and all other things fantasy/sci-fi related! Naturally that is going to reflect in my work. I hope you enjoy looking at it as much as I enjoyed putting it all together.
